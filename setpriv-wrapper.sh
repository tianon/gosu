# This script is a wrapper around "setpriv" (part of util-linux) which implements a fully gosu-compatible interface (and passes gosu's test suite).
#
# It is written in POSIX shell for maximum compatbility, but notably does *not* work with BusyBox's setpriv (as of 2024-06-03) as BusyBox does not implement enough functionality.
#

# TODO GOSU_PLEASE_LET_ME_BE_COMPLETELY_INSECURE_I_GET_TO_KEEP_ALL_THE_PIECES (block setuid/setgid) -- however, you can't effectively setuid a shell script/interpreted file, so maybe it's fine? ðŸ¤”
